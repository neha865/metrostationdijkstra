# metrostationdijkstra
Did my Dsa project on one of the best algorithms which is used to find the shortest path for a given source and destination called "Dijkstra algorithm" 

Here you can see we have chosen blue line, green line of chennai metro station as input as graph coordinates in form of matrix (directed graph).

next we have named each place as number from 0 to 33 
given below:
"Thiruvottiyur Metro"
"Washermanpet Metro",
"Mannadi",
"High Court",
"Chennai Central",
"Government Estate",
"LIC",
"Thousand Lights",
"AG-DMS",
"Teynampet",
"Nandanam",
"Saidapet Metro",
"Little Mount",
"Guindy Metro",
"Alandur",
"Nanganallur Road",
"St. Thomas Mount",
"Adambakkam",
"Meenambakkam Metro",
"Airport",
"Egmore Metro",
"Nehru park",
"Kilpauk",
"Pachaiyappa's College",
"Shenoy Nagar",
"Anna Nagar East",
"Anna Nagar Tower",
"Thirumangalam",
"Koyambedu",
"CMBT",
"Arumbakkam",
"Vadapalani",
"Ashok Nagar",
"Ekkatuthangal",
"St. Thomas Mount Metro"

giving this as input to the program, we have found shortest path for each station

what is happening?
->Firstly, we have to enter the source 
->Now, it will calculate all shortest paths from this source to every other station(33)
-> flexible,easy to use and understand
